Covid-19 data analysis, pivot analysis and creating Data Dashboard by using Excel

## Covid-19 India Analysis


## Introduction
The COVID-19 pandemic has had a profound impact on public health, and understanding the data is crucial for decision-making and resource allocation. This project aims to provide valuable insights and create a data-driven dashboard to aid in understanding the pandemic's progression and its effects on different regions of India.

## Problem Statement
- Extract COVID-19 data for India using Excel and the Data module.
- Parse and clean the data, ensuring consistency and handling missing values.
- Perform Pivot to create an Excel dashboard with the following insights:
    - Weekly evolution of confirmed cases, recoveries, deaths, and tests.
    - Categorize districts based on testing ratios and analyze deaths across categories.
    - Compare delta7 confirmed cases with vaccination data.
    - Create KPIs to assess case severity in different states.
    - Categorize total confirmed cases by month to identify the worst month for India.
  

                
`Data Analysis`

Employed pivot tables to summarize and aggregate the data, facilitating the creation of necessary charts and visualizations for the dashboard.

`Dashboard Creation`

Developed a dynamic Excel dashboard for effective data presentation. The dashboard featured various interactive elements, including slicers and bookmark features, allowing seamless switching between state-level analysis views.


## Dashboard
- The dashboard offers two views state, allowing users to switch between them using bookmarks. 
- It includes various filters for exploring different scenarios.

## Key Insights

`Monthly Trend Analysis`

A consistent monthly trend emerged in each year, with a significant surge in confirmed cases observed in May. Prior to May, cases remained relatively low, gradually increasing. However, May saw an exponential rise in confirmed cases.

`Testing Ratio Impact`

Districts exhibiting the lowest testing ratios tended to experience higher numbers of cases and deaths. This suggests a potential correlation between testing efforts and case outcomes.

`Population Density Effect`

States with higher population density, such as Maharashtra, tended to report more cases and deaths. In contrast, regions with lower population density, like Lakshadweep, recorded the lowest numbers of confirmed cases.

`Seven-Day Moving Average`

An analysis of the seven-day moving average of confirmed cases revealed Kerala as a standout, demonstrating a substantial difference compared to other states. This indicates unique trends in the disease's progression in Kerala.


## Challenges Faced

`Data Extraction` 

We initially faced difficulties in getting data from the server, but we persevered and figured it out.

`Data Cleanup` 

Dealing with messy data, including missing values and confusing entries, was a challenge. We brainstormed and tried different methods to clean it up and make it useful.

`Data Visualization` 

Visualizing the data in a way that answered the project's questions was tough. We had to think creatively and work as a team to present the data effectively.

`Time Management`

Meeting project deadlines required good time management skills, and we learned to prioritize tasks efficiently.

## Learnings

`Persistence` 

We learned to keep trying when faced with data extraction problems.

`Data Cleaning` 

We improved our skills in making messy data useful through experimentation.

`Creative Problem-Solving` 

We found creative ways to visualize complex data through teamwork.

`Teamwork and Communication` 

Working with diverse viewpoints improved our communication and collaboration skills.

`Time Management`

Efficiently managing our time became crucial to meet project deadlines.
